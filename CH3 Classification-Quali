I. 
   In many situations, the response variables could be qualitative. One approach is classification. It predicte the probability of the oberservations that belongs to the qualitative categorization.
   5 types classifiers in the note: logistic regression, linear discrimizant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, naive Bayes, K-nearest enighbors
   Two reasons why not using linear Regression: For categorizations larger than 2, meaningless assigned numbers. For two cates, assign 1 and 0 but the estimated Y may exceed [0,1].

II. Logistic Regression, range [0,1]
1. The logi model
   Logi func: p(X) = e^(b0 + b1*X) / 1 + e^(b0 + b1*X)
   write as:  p(X) = A/(1+A) if set A= e^(b0 + b1*X)
   trans to:  p(X) / ( 1-p(x) ) = A, here p(X) / ( 1-p(x) ) is called odds, [0,+infinity]
   both log:  log( p(X) / ( 1-p(x) ) ) = b0 + b1X, here log( p(X) / ( 1-p(x) ) ) is called log odds or say logit
              One unit Increasing in X changes the log odds by b1, b1 does not correspond to the change in p(X), change in p(X) depends on the value of X.
              But still, if b1 is positive, then the increaseing in X associates with increasing in p(X).
2. Estimate the regression coefficients

I. In many situations, the response variables could be qualitative. One approach is classification. It predicte the probability of the oberservations that belongs to the qualitative categorization.
5 types classifiers in the note: logistic regression, linear discrimizant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, naive Bayes, K-nearest enighbors

1. Two reasons why not using linear Regression: For categorizations larger than 2, meaningless assigned numbers. For two cates, assign 1 and 0 but the estimated Y may exceed [0,1].

II. Logistic Regression, range [0,1]
p(X) = e^(b0 + b1*X) / 1 + e^(b0 + b1*X)
say A= e^(b0 + b1*X), Px = A/(1+A)

by some calculation

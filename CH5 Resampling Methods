Two main methods: 
  Corss-Validation: used for model selection (flexibility selection) and model assessment (evaluation); 
      LOOCV(Leave-one-out cross-validation)
      K-Fold Cross-Validation
  Bootstrap: used for measuring accuracy of estimation of a parameter
 
 
 I. Cross-Validation
    estimating the test error rate (which in a quanti case is MSE, in quali case is mismatch rate) by holding out a subset of traning observations as the test set
  
    1. LOOCV(Leave-one-out cross-validation)

    2. K-Fold Cross-Validation
 
 II. BootStrap

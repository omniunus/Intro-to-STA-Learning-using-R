1.What is statistical learning?
   Develope an accurate model that can be used to predict responses using predictors.
   Y = f(x) + e
   We are trying to estimate f for prediction and inference purpose.
   Y^ = f^(x)
   f(x) = f^(x) + reducible error
   
   Y = f(x) + e = f^(x) + reducible error + e
   
   E(Y-Y^)^2 = reducible error + e
             = [f(x) -f^(x)]^2 + var(e)
             = E[f(x) + e - f^(x)]^2
             = E[Y-Y^]^2
Some R bases: 
1. create a function:
  MyFunc = function(){ xxxx }
  when use, MyFunc()

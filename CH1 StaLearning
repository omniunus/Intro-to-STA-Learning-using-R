I. What is statistical learning?
   Develope an accurate model that can be used to predict responses using predictors.
1. f(x)
   Y = f(x) + e
2. f^(x)
   We are trying to estimate f for prediction and inference purpose.
   Y^ = f^(x)
   f(x) = f^(x) + reducible error
   
   Y = f(x) + e = f^(x) + reducible error + e
3. We are focusing on bringing down the reducible error
   E(Y-Y^)^2 = reducible error + e
             = [f(x) -f^(x)]^2 + var(e)
             = E[f(x) + e - f^(x)]^2
             = E[Y-Y^]^2
4. How we estimate f? parametric and non-parametric
   parametric: make presumptions about the model, extimate the parameters. 
   non-parametric: need a very large number of observations. 
5. Trade-off between prediction accuracy and interpretability (flexibility has more variance, non_flexible has more bias)
6. Supervised and un-supervised learning
   unsupervised learning does not has the response value Y
7. Regression and Classification Problems
   regression - quantitatice response
   classification - qualitative response. We do use regression for binary quali by setting dummy varibales.
II. Testify Model Accuracy
 1. Measuring the quality of fitness, using: MSE (mean squared error)
    MSE: mean sqr error, MSE = (1/n) * sum from i=1 to i=n ( Yi-f^(Xi) )^2, sum sqr the diff between predicted and observed responses for Xi
    We wish a small MSE, we pick the model with the smallest TEST MSE
    We care about the TEST MSE, the training MSE usually always perform better than the test MSE.
    Notice the U-shape 
   
   
Some R bases: 
1. create a function:
  MyFunc = function(){ xxxx }
  when use, MyFunc()
